### 9 IDE
I am using Visual Studio as IDE. The reason I choose this IDE is because its the best IDE for .Net development. Visual Studio has some very powerfull features like step by step code debugging, break point ability, AI to learn the programmer code and then make it easy to automatically complete lines of code, version control, collabarative development and much more. 

**Favorite Key-Shortcuts:**

**Ctrl + K & Ctrl + U:** Comment and uncomment selected block of code.<br>
**Ctrl + K + D:** Format docuemnt.<br>
**Ctrl + M + O:** All methods close to definitions.<br>
**Ctrl + Tab:** Switch open widnows within visual studio.
